## Development process
- in this project my idea was to develop Product shop with search function from API and Product list;
but unfortunately the API has an internal server error :( and i change the idea to task list with gallery from another API. 
- First I start with the tasks functionality add,done/undone,clear/clearAll then I use the gallery API to browse the images, Finally Bootstrab and CSS design.   

## Future Work
- I will search for API that I can get products and search for brands and categoris based on the user input. 
- Improve the design. 

## Favorite Functionality 
- My Task List is my favorite part in this project because of using many component and discover how react actullay works!
